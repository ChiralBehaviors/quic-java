# JQQUIC -- A Java language binding library for Google(R) QUIC protocol.
---
This project is to provide a Google(R) QUIC Java library.
Trying to make a HTTP/2 UDP server framework that based on QUIC protocol stack. 
With chrome client, and Google cronet for Android/iOS that support QUIC, we need a server side implementation with Java. 
So to improve performance and solve networking issue with roaming mobile client. 
This project started from C++ libquic. Eventually it'll provide Java API as well as server adapter for Netty and Tomcat etc.
