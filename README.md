---
* This project is to provide a Google(R) QUIC Java library, and a HTTP/2 UDP server framework. 
* With chrome client, and Google cronet for Android/iOS that support QUIC, we need a server side implementation for Java. 
* It'll improve performance and solve some networking issue for roaming mobile clients. 
* It started from C++ libquic, and to provide Java API as well as server adapter for Netty and Tomcat.
